# PREREQUISITES

You must install sjparkinson/static-review in the root of your project. 

``` bash
$ composer require sjparkinson/static-review
```

and create a new Hooks directory and copy static-review-pre-commit.php into.

``` bash
$ mkdir Hooks
$ copy vendor/sjparkinson/static-review/hooks/static-review-pre-commit.php Hooks/static-review-pre-commit.php
```

# CHANGE LOG

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information what has changed recently.

# INSTALLATION

You can install the package via composer:

``` bash
$ composer require padosoft/static-review
```

Open Hooks/static-review-pre-commit.php in your root folder (created in PREREQUISITES above section) and add custom review.
For example if you want to add VarDumpReview and DdReview:

``` php
$review->addReview(new LineEndingsReview())
        //.....
        //.....
        //.....
        //.....
       ->addReview(new VarDumpReview());
       ->addReview(new DdReview());
```

In the end, create a pre-commit hook, by running the following command:

``` bash
$ vendor/bin/static-review.php hook:install hooks/static-review-pre-commit.php .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

And with that, if you look in .git/hooks, youâ€™ll now see a symlink created from pre-commit, to our new hooks file.
